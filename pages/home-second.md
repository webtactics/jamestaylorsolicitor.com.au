<p><em>“Being contacted by the police about a criminal offence, attending the police station, receiving court attendance notices for criminal and driving offences or any other involvement in traffic matters can be a concerning and worrying experience.</em></p>

<p><em>From my past experience in representing clients in criminal and driving offences I understand client’s concerns and what is at stake and most importantly what needs to be done to provide clients with the best possible representation.</em></p>

<p><em>I pride myself and take great satisfaction from making sure that my clients obtain the best possible results in all matters”</em></p>
